      <h1>Sarah A. Kusnetz</h1>
      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p> I am a Junior Journalism and Design Major at the New School.
        I have a four year old dog named Sugar, she's the best. 
        On my days off you can find us at the dog park. I am a Libra and a Rooster. 
        Huge fan of Spongebob, Lord of the Rings, and all things Tina Fey and Amy Pohler.</p>
      
      <h3>Sugar</h3>
      <p> Sugar is a four year old yellow lab. She likes long walks on the beach, steak dinners, and long naps. 
      Which is perfect because I also love all of those things.</p>
      
      <h3>Libra Rooster</h3>
      <p> Born October 8th, 1993 to Marcia and Dan Kusnetz. I have three older brothers. 
        The libra in me makes it hard to make decisions, yet I find I have a problem ceeding control to others. The Rooster makes me cocky ;) .</p>

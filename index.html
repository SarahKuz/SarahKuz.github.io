      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p> I am a Junior Journalism and Design Major at the New School.
        I have a four-year-old pup named Sugar.
        On my days off you can find us at the dog park. I am a Libra and a Rooster. 
        Huge fan of Spongebob, Lord of the Rings, and all things Tina Fey and Amy Pohler.</p>

      <p> Sugar is a four year old yellow lab. She likes long walks on the beach, steak dinners, and long naps. 
      Which is perfect because I also love all of those things.</p>
